# Healthcare Management System

## Overview

This project implements a Healthcare Management System using Python and PyQt5 for the frontend and SQLite for the backend database. It provides functionalities for managing patients, appointments, medical records, and staff within a university medical support setting.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Add, view, and manage patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule appointments for patients who want to do his treatment after some times.
- **Medical Record Management**: Maintain medical records including diagnoses and treatments.
- **Staff Management**: Add and manage staff members including doctors and administrative staff.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: Language used for development.
- **PyQt5**: Python bindings for Qt, used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **SQLite**: Embedded relational database management system used for storing patient and medical data.

## Design Patterns Applied

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:
  - **Model**: Includes Python classes representing data entities such as Patient, MedicalRecord, and Staff.
  - **View**: Implemented using PyQt5 widgets for user interaction.
  - **Controller**: Manages user inputs and interactions, updating the model and view accordingly.

- **Singleton**: Implemented in the Database utility class to ensure a single database connection throughout the application's lifecycle.
